                    question: "What is a Music Kard from DirectImage Cards?",
                    answer: " Music Kard is a plastic card (like a credit card) that is designed with the Artist Logo and information about the artist and has QR codes for one time downloads of the Artist’s original music.        The Music Kard can also have two QR codes.  The first QR code will allow the customer to download the music from the artist.  This is a one -time download to the Customers phone or tablet or computer.  The reason for the one-time download is to restrict fans from sharing the QR code with other fans and not having to buy the music.  The Second QR code will be from the artist – it could be a video of the artist thanking their fans for buying the card and telling some information to the fans or it could be a link to a you tube video of the Artist.\n"

                    question: "What is a QR code and why does DirectImage Cards use QR codes for music and videos?",
                    answer: "A QR code is a computer-generated bar code that points to a server and downloads what the server has been programmed to relay to a mobile phone, tablet or computer utilizing a QR code reader which is free to download on all app stores.  DirectImage Cards chose QR codes as a vehicle for music delivery because we could insure that the QR code has a one-time download to a mobile phone, tablet or computer and it will go directly to your music file.  Thus, we prevent sharing of music between fans with only one purchase.  However, we can also make the QR code available for any fan to download videos which customers can share with anybody.  We want to insure the integrity of the music download.  That is what you are selling and for us a QR code delivers.  \n"

                    question: "Why did DirectImage Cards get into the business of Music Kards?",
                    answer: "DirectImage Cards is in the business of creating plastic cards for all types of business and social occasions.  We work with companies to communicate to their customers by providing souvenir cards as well as ID Badges, Child Find Cards, luggage tags, and mobile apps and websites that will provide cards as well.  When we researched the current state of the music business we saw a lot of struggling indie artists that were trying to get their music out and not making very much money in doing it.  We felt that the Music Kards we would offer and the custom service and support we could offer would allow Artists the opportunity to get their music to more fans and make more money in the process.  We are looking to partner with Artists on a 50/50 basis and we are offering our initial services such as card design for free so the Artist does not have large upfront fees to get their music out to their fans.  If you are willing to work with DirectImage Cards and promote your music we are looking for you.  "

                    question: "How do I design a Music Kard from DirectImage Cards? To design a Music Kard from DirectImage Cards we need the following:",
                    answer: "A.\tPlease refer to our Music Kard page to reference the cards we have on the site.  We will design a front and back of the card for you in our basic template.  \n" +
                    "B.\tLogos of the Artist in high resolution graphics – we prefer png images\n" +
                    "C.\tText from the Artist on what you want on the card\n" +
                    "D.\tA scan of your signature so we can make the card a signature card for your fans \n" +
                    "E.\tLinks to your social media accounts \n" +
                    "F.\tLinks to your original music that you want to sell on the card – this will be stored on our server and when the QR code is activated the music will download from our server.  Please note that you can send us one song per music card or an entire album worth of music.  It just depends on what you want to sell to the customer.  You can also sell multiple cards on your website.  Perhaps you want to sell one card with one song for one price and another card for 10 songs at another price.  It is up to you.\n" +
                    "G.\tVideo of the Artist or you tube or another social media link.  It is our recommendation that you record a video of yourself and thank the customer for ordering the card and then tell them about yourself and make the video special that they can only get on your Music Kard.  \n" +
                    "H.\tFinally, we will send the Music Kard to you for final approval.  We will accommodate small changes but the basic template will not change.  If you are creative, and want to design your own card we will attempt to accommodate you provided we can.\n" +
                    "I.\tPlease send all graphics to I.\tmusickard@directimagecards.com.  Please include your full contact information if we have questions for you.\n"

                    question: "What is the cost of the set up and design of the Music Kard?     It It is Free but there are conditions to the Free offer.  What are the conditions?",
                    answer: "A.           The Music Kard will be sold on your website for $9.95 or above. You decide what you want to charge for the card but it is our belief that $9.95 is the correct cost and sales will be affected by an increase over the $9.95 price point.   If you have a website and you are currently selling T Shirts or any other collectibles and you have a shopping cart, DirectImage Cards will send your webmaster a button that will enable you to sell the Music Kard on your site.  When a customer purchases a Music Kard on your site – we expect payment from you before a Music Kard is sent to the customer.  We accept all major credit cards and when we get paid we will ship the card to your customer and send you an email that the card has been shipped.  We will also send you a quarterly statement of how many cards you have sold and will provide you with a detailed shipping list of where the cards went.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "B.\tSince we are designing the cards and setting up your account, we expect that the first 50 cards that we sell we will receive $8.95.  The 51st card sold will then make us 50/50 partners and we will expect payment of $4.97 and you get $4.98 per card on subsequent sales.  So you get paid $1.00 per card for the first 50 cards sold and $4.98 on all subsequent sales.   If you decide to sell the card at a higher price you can potentially make more – all DirectImage Cards expects is $8.95 for the first 50 cards and $4.97 for the rest of the cards.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "C.\tWhat if I don’t have a website to sell the Music Kards?  DirectImage Cards will create you a web page for $200 that will be housed on our server for 1 year.  We will need a credit card from you for the $200 plus applicable taxes and we will need a commitment from you to be able to sell 5 cards a month. Also, the first 50 cards we will take $8.95 per card and you will receive $1.00 per card.  After 50 cards, we will take $4.97 and send you a cheque for the additional amount that we are making on your cards.  Since we are creating the web page, we will collect the funds and then pay you the per card fee as per our agreement.  If you cannot get your followers or fans to buy 5 Music Kards a month then our service is probably not the right service for you.  If at the end of 6 months you have not hit the 5 cards a month minimum then we reserve the right to either charge you a monthly fee for our server for your web page or disconnect your web page.\n"
